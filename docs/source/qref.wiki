<center>'''OpenEMR v4.2 Quick Reference Handout '''</center>


= Purpose: =
This handout is a reference source to many basic OpenEMR activities, with pointers to more information for further study. It is not a tutorial in itself, but is intended as a reminder sheet for what was learned in the more comprehensive tutorials and online videos. If printed out as a pdf, it can be viewed in the same terminal as OpenEMR; links to materials are given as external links for use in that scenario.

= Sources: =
:* Much of the handout is abbreviated content from the OpenEMR User Guide, found on the OpenEMR Wiki at: <br/> '''''http://open-emr.org/wiki/index.php/OpenEMR_Wiki_Home_Page#User_Manuals. '''''<br/> 

:* The first half of this handout closely reflects the first three pages of the OpenEMR v4.2 User Guide: <br/> Getting Started <br/> Main Screen & Navigation <br/> Setting Up Your Clinic <br/> 

:* In those User Guides (or Manuals) the Supplementary Topics mentioned below are listed underneath the Main Topics. <br/> 

:* While learning the OpenEMR interface, consider printing out the (illustrated) 4.2 User Guide section, "Main Screen & Navigation" to keep by your OpenEMR terminals. The few differences between it and the 4.1.2 version may be manually corrected. <br/> 

:* PLEASE NOTE: these instructions apply to a standard/ stock installation of OpenEMR. Any system customization may modify features and capabilities. <br/>

= OpenEMR Interface Navigation Principles: =
:* The majority of OpenEMR's functions are initiated through the left navigation ("nav") menu 
:* Clicking on the nav menu item displays the interface (screen, panel or dialog) for that activity in either the top or bottom panel of the main OpenEMR display on the right side of the screen.
:* Each menu item is either a distinct task by itself OR is the entrance point to a collection of related tasks. For example: 

The '''Administration-> ACL '''menu item displays a single panel from which the only thing you do is set users' access permissions. 

The '''Administration-> Globals '''menu item displays a single panel but it has multiple tabs with settings for many different functions.
